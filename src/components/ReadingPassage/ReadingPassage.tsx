      <h2>Title</h2>
      <p>
        The long-standing debate about whether to fluoridate our drinking water
        continues Fluoridation is the addition of fluorine to public water
        supplies with the aim of reducing tooth decay. The fluorine, when mixed
        with water, becomes fluoride and the desired concentration of fluoride
        in public water is approximately one part per million, depending on the
        regional temperature and hence the amount of water people are likely to
        drink. Many studies, such as those by McClure in 1970 through to Burt in
        1983, have shown that when children drink fluoridated water, their
        average rate of tooth decay seems greatly reduced. A typical figure
        claimed is 50 percent reduction. This apparently enormous benefit for
        children's teeth is the major argument in favor of fluoridation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three main grounds for opposition to fluoridation have been expressed.
        First, opponents claim the benefits are exaggerated or not established.
        Second, there are claims of health risks to pans of the population, for
        example, allergic reactions. It is also accepted that high levels of
        fluoride can cause discoloration of otherwise healthy teeth. Proponents
        do not consider this to be a problem in such small concentrations,
        whereas opponents disagree - especially because some people drink more
        water and obtain much more than the standard 1 milligram of fluoride per
        day. Third, fluoridation is thought to be an infringement on individual
        rights because it is compulsory medication of all members of a
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        An understanding of the fluoridation issue has important implications.
        If, according to the experts, fluoridation is unquestionably a
        beneficial and non-hazardous measure, then the wisdom of allowing the
        public to vote on, and reject it must be questioned.
